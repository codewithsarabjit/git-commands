BASIC COMMANDS TO COMMIT AND PUSH YOUR CHANGES
git status  # it shows you all the changes in red

git add .   # add all the changes in the current branch

git commit -m "write your commit message here"      # commits all the added changes

git push remotename branchname      # pushes all unpushed commits to the specified remote and branch.
example: git push origin main

COMMANDS TO REMOTE A COMMIT FROM LOCAL/REMOTE/BOTH
Be careful that this will create an "alternate reality" for people 
who have already fetch/pulled/cloned from the remote repository. 
But in fact, it's quite simple:

git reset HEAD^ # remove commit locally
git push origin +HEAD # force-push the new HEAD commit

If you want to still have it in your local repository and 
only remove it from the remote, then you can use:

git push origin +HEAD^:<name of your branch, most likely 'master'>
